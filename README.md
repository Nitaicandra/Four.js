# Four.js
Built Using Three.js Typescript and vite 
This program uses custom Multi-dimesnional point and line generation algorthmns that were made by generalizing patterns observed when creating cuboids of higher dimensions.

Point generation done from in order of axis ie starting at 1,1,1... and draws from right to left
Line genration is done 1 axis at a time unitl it draws all of the lines for every axis.
The algorthms are cyclic in nature and somwhat reminscent of the increasing order of binary numbers.

Runs in the browser built using vite and typescript
Todo: create multi dimensional rotational matrix algorthms.
